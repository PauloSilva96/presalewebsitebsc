        <h1>Whitepaper: MemeZord Token</h1>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>MemeZord is an innovation in the world of cryptocurrencies, combining all existing meme coins with the help of artificial intelligence. Our goal is to create the ultimate meme coin, highly deflationary and with exclusive benefits for holders.</p>
        
        <h2>Functioning Mechanism</h2>
        <p>MemeZord imposes a 2% transaction fee, with 1% being allocated to the project wallet to finance development, marketing, and community events. The other 1% is automatically burned, enhancing the token scarcity and appreciating each unit.</p>
        
        <h2>Token Distribution</h2>
        <p>For the initial sale, we offer 750 million tokens at a price of 250 thousand per BNB. Additionally, we reserve 250 million tokens for the team (devs/reserve/marketing), totaling an initial supply of 1 billion tokens.</p>
        
        <h2>Use of Funds</h2>
        <p>The 1% of fees allocated to the project wallet will be used in community Telegram votes. This includes organizing events, donations to charitable organizations, listings on larger exchanges, among others.</p>
        
        <h2>Pre-sale</h2>
        <p>The pre-sale will last for 60 days, during which investors can purchase tokens. After the pre-sale ends, holders can claim their tokens.</p>
        
        <h2>Listed on PancakeSwap</h2>
        <p>MemeZord will be listed initially on PancakeSwap, the first decentralized exchange chosen for the launch. During the pre-sale, the team will be working to seek listings on other renowned exchanges.</p>
